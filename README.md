# The Implicit Genome Simulator

If you got here from the paper "Alternate mutation modalities in models of population dynamics", that was due to a typo on my part.  This was a previous version of the project that went unfinished.  The actual URL for the project is:

https://github.com/johnnyb/implicit-genome-simulator-go

Sorry for the inconvenience.
